<p align="center"><i><font size="4">advice about practicing the banjo</font></i></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to learn to play reasonably
well, you will need to practice an
average of at least 30 minutes a day. This is true even if you aspire to a
modest level of skill, and want only to play for friends and family in the
living room.&nbsp;That's a perfectly good goal to have, but still requires
dilligent practice!</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you aspire to really play well,
perhaps playing in a band with other musicians and maybe in public, you
will end up practicing <b>at least one hour a day</b>.&nbsp; But understand that
anyone who is practicing that much <i>is really enjoying their practice time
anyway</i>!
When
Bela Fleck and Earl Scruggs started out playing as kids, they sometimes
practiced in their bedrooms for the whole day!&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like anything else worth learning, it will take time to start sounding like a pretty good picker. Be patient and
PRACTICE. Compare it to learning a new foreign language. That can take many
years of practice until you become fluent. The same holds true for any musical instrument and the
banjo is no different. Accept that this is a <i> long-term undertaking</i>. If you are
realistic about the amount of practice needed, and the long term commitment
needed, you will definitely make progress. There's
just no getting around the need for daily practice.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, you can begin to teach yourself bluegrass banjo from your favorite websites, videos, and tapes, because any good
musician is self-motivated. But be careful to not develop sloppy playing
technique, which can happen if you go too long without a real teacher to keep
you on track and away from bad habits, which are near impossible to break! You
will soon need a real teacher to guide you. <a href="bluegrass_banjo_teachers.htm"><font color="#FFFF00">BLUEGRASS BANJO
