<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>People who take the step of calling a banjo
teacher for lessons generally fall into two categories: First, there are the
beginners that have little or no background in banjo and are interested in
starting from step one. They usually start with Cripple Creek or something
similar and need to be guided by the teacher on basic concepts and technique.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second category is made up of those
individuals who could be called advanced beginners or intermediate level players
and are interested in moving up to a more advanced level of playing. They often
state that they are stuck with a handful of solos and picking patterns and
need guidance to improve to the point where they can play along easily with
others, improvise and make up their own solos to songs. After having watched
advanced players perform and improvise effortlessly, they want to know how to do
it and they want to do it soon.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here are ten suggestions directed towards
those who want to transition to the next level:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="1">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Be patient with your progress</b>. Making the
    transition to the next level on bluegrass banjo does not happen in a
    short period of time, certainly not within a year. It is a multi-year
    project that occurs gradually. If you can accept this fact and be patient
    with your <i>steady progress over the years</i>, you will make the
    transition in time. No competent player learned to improvise or play a solo
    extemporaneously without spending quite a number of years in a growth
    period. Actually, the best players will tell you that the growth process
    lasts a lifetime.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Familiarize yourself with the classic recordings</b>
    of all the important players, not just the one or two most famous ones.
    While it may not be possible to be exposed to each and every standard,
    you should begin the process of expanding your repertoire of tunes by
    listening as much as possible over an extended period to the body of works
    that make up this genre. This is also a multi-year process. You can begin
    this by checking out my book of solos(<a href="order_one_hundred_banjo_tabs.htm"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4"><b>Ben's
    Personal Tab Collection::One Hundred Essential Bluegrass Banjo Solos&nbsp;</b></font></a></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Work with a real teacher</b>. A good teacher is
    indispensable and will 1. correct your bad technical habits, 2. show you new
    repertoire using tablature and recordings, 3. teach you some theory and
    expand your knowledge of the fingerboard, and, perhaps most importantly, 4.
    inspire you towards improvement. Keep in mind that 90% of the learning
    process will be achieved by you on your own, while the teacher is there to
    keep you on the right track. You may not be able to commit to weekly
    lessons, but good personal guidance, even if only on an intermittent basis,
    will be invaluable.<a href="bluegrass_banjo_teachers.htm"> Check this
    international list of BLUEGRASS BANJO teachers</a></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Record yourself</b> while practicing, and then <i>listen
    back</i>. This feedback technique is invaluable for selfadjusting any
    possible timing and articulation deficiencies.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Make up arrangements</b> of songs you know already.
    This might take a few hours of practice per song, but is well worth the
    exercise. Show your variation to your teacher for modifications and advice.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Compose</b> your own original melodies. Most people
    who write originals do this by just sitting down and casually messing around
    with the banjo, or noodling. Composing your own songs doesnt mean
    they must be performed publicly, but it is a great way of learning the
    fingerboard and developing your improvisational style. If youre not sure
    where to begin, you can start by simply copying the ideas in a song you
    already know.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Learn to play the classic repertoire</b>, which is
    made up of a few hundred standard solos. A good player will be familiar with most
    of the classic bluegrass banjo solos and be able to call them up from memory
    in a few minutes. This process, again, takes many years. Its not a bad
    idea to play carefully through your whole repertoire every time you
    practice. Even if your goal is not mastery, understand that all students of
    musical performance are encouraged to learn the classic repertoire of their
    instrument, whether it is jazz piano, Irish fiddle, classical guitar, or
    bluegrass banjo. Accept that this is an important aspect of transitioning to
    advanced levels of playing and take it on as a multi-year project. Check
    out.<a href="order_one_hundred_banjo_tabs.htm"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4"><b>Ben's
    Personal Tab Collection::One Hundred Essential Bluegrass Banjo Solos&nbsp;</b></font></a></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Learn multitrack recording</b>: Multitrack(sound-on-sound)
    recording can be done nowadays on an affordable cassette recorders(under
    $200) or high priced digital audio workstations, and home computers.
    Without getting into the details here of how its done, suffice it to say
    that learning sound-on-sound recording techniques is invaluable in
    developing a variety of skills on your instrument, including control,
    dynamics and timing. It also presents the opportunity to dub in other
    instruments, which will give you an appreciation for the harmonic and
    rhythmic support needed to back up your instrument. Also, a little knowledge
    of studio engineering is useful for any musician.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Practice every day.</b> For generations much has
    been said about the value of practice, so without reinventing the wheel
    here, lets say that for bluegrass banjo students, modest but real
    progress can be made if a daily 30 minute commitment is made. I should add,
    however, that students of mine who end up actually playing at a high level,
    come back to say they have actually been practicing 2-3 hours a day.
    Thats when practicing becomes most enjoyable. Dont forget occasional
    work with a metronome.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Play music with other musicians</b>. For real
    musical growth, there is perhaps no substitute whatsoever for playing with
    other musicians on a regular basis.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
     tab-stops:list .5in"><b>Perform publicly</b>. If you can find a venue to
    perform in front of a live audience, you will hopefully use the opportunity
    to ratchet-up your abilities a level or two.</li>
