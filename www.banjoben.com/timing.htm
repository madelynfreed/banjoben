<p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Play <b><font size="4"> slowly and accurately </font></b> as you learn. Do not try to play fast if you are
not playing accurately. Speedy playing is
absolutely not
important at first, and may impede your real progress if your technique is
sloppy. Speed playing will come naturally after working on accuracy.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many teachers advise that their
students use a metronome to help with timing. This is a good idea. You want your
fingers (and the rest of your body for that matter) to learn how to play in correct time as if you had an &quot;inner
metronome&quot;. This can take time and lots of practice. It is a learned skill.
Basically, with the metronome, you want to start with a slow tempo and <b> gradually</b> move into faster tempos.<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">
I recommend that you start out playing&nbsp; no faster than about 60 Beats Per
Minute (one beat per second, with four beats to the measure). This may seem too
slow at first glance, but realistically, it may take a few weeks of daily
practice to play all the way through your first tune (Cripple Creek) at this
tempo without stopping. Be patient with your progress, as it takes time for
everyone at first. All teachers will tell you that students tend to want to play
fast at first and end up playing sloppily as a result. The teacher would much
rather hear you play the whole piece through slowly, cleanly and in perfect time
at first, before increasing your speed. After some weeks of practice with the
metronome, you will develop the discipline to keep good time on your own.</span></font></p>

you find yourself unable to play &quot;in time&quot;, i.e. if your playing
sounds disorganized and you are having trouble straightening it out, you will
definitely need to have a profession banjo instructor help you with basic
musical skills. I recommend that all students get a real teacher eventually
anyway. The best advice is to read through instructional materials such as this
on your own to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts and&nbsp; find a
teacher as soon as possible so that you do not develop bad musical habits.</font></span></p>

a word about <b>t</b></span><b></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><b>ransitioning
between parts</b>: One of the hard things to do when learning is to play through
the tune coherently while keeping in time from beginning to end. This includes
making smooth transitions, meaning that when you complete the A part of
the song and it is time to repeat the A part, you should be able to make a
smooth transition to begin the A part again while maintaining proper
rhythm. Or when transitioning from the end of the song back to the beginning,
such as when playing a song through twice in a row. This takes practice at
first, and a teacher can help you with this. Listen carefully for these smooth
transitions on the CD. </span></font><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
