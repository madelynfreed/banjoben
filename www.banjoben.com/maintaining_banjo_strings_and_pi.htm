<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in" align="left"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>With poorly maintained strings and picks, a nice banjo will
never reach its full sonic potential. You can optimize the tone of the banjo by
doing the following with your picks and strings:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First, donÂ’t let the strings get rusty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This can happen if they are even slightly moist with humidity or
perspiration, and then left not played for weeks, when oxidation can build up.
Beginning players often have rusty strings because they may not have cleaned or
changed them. If they are rusty, throw them away and put on new ones.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Dirty strings can be almost impossible to tune, and careful routine
cleaning will help keep them tunable and will easily double or triple their
useful life. At the end of every<i> </i>session or gig, rub down the strings
individually with a dry chamois (fine leather). Surround the entire string with
the chamois and rub up and down the full length of the string a few times,
cleaning off the grime. Then take a look at whatÂ’s left in the chamois. The
black oxidation and dirt will kill its brightness after one picking session if
left on the string. After cleaning, keep the banjo stored dry in the case until
next time. (You can get a chamois cloth in any auto parts store. It is very soft
and used to buff car finishes and jewelry. It is also good for cleaning and
buffing the finish of your musical instruments.) Just cleaning the
outward-facing side of the string by rubbing along the face of the fingerboard
is not sufficient.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adding a commercial string lubricant
without a careful rub-down cleaning of the individuals strings will not be of
value. I donÂ’t use string lubricants because I feel they add a coating which
can only result in a dampening effect.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thumb pick maintainance: Most bluegrass players use a plastic, as opposed
to a metal<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>pick. If you are having
trouble keeping your thumb pick on, then it is the wrong style, size, or gauge
for your finger. Try another brand, size or thicker gauge. It may need a shape
adjustment as described below. Both metal and plastic picks tend to soften and
get loose with the heat of your finger after an hour or so of intense playing,
especially in a warm environment. The heavier the gauge, for both thumb picks
and metal fingerpicks, the less that tends to occur. And most light gauge thumb
picks tend to eventually break. So, I now use Golden Gate heavies for these
reasons. The heavy gauge definitely gives me more control, power transference
and volume when I need it. It took about a month to get my thumb use to them
properly, but now everything else feels inadequate and a little wimpy on my
thumb. They are tight, rock-solid reliable and rarely break.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If your plastic thumbpick seems to not be
shaped well to your thumb, re-shape it by heating in hot water to soften it so
you can re-bend it to your needs. First boil a cup or two of water in a small
pot. Then use long-nose pliers to hold the pick and submerse the section that
needs re-shaping in the boiling water for about 10 seconds, not much more.
Quickly, while the plastic is soft, use a second plier to reshape the section.
Be careful not to submerse the whole pick in the water because it will lose its
shape memory completely and will have to be discarded. Also, if you clamp down
on the soft plastic directly with a metal plier, you will cause indentations
from the metal, and that can ruin the picking side of the blade of the pick, so
use a cloth(try that chamois) between the plier and the plastic to protect the
plastic. This operation takes a little practice, and you may make some mistakes
at first.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Dreaded Pick Scrape Noise:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This scraping sound can occur with either the thumb pick or finger picks,
but it tends to be more prominent with the thumb pick. It drives me crazy! The
first thing to do if you are getting a scraping sound from the picks as they
strike the string is to insure that both the strings and the pick surfaces are <i>smooth</i>
and dirt-free. For the thumb pick, make sure the surface of the blade is not
pitted or rough. You can try rubbing the blade lengthwise with an emery cloth or
very fine sandpaper to smooth out the surface. Also, try wiping the blade of the
thumb pick with lubricant such as fine machine oil. That scraping sound can also
be caused by the fact that the flat part of the blade may not be striking the
string.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With thumb picks, you
may be able to slightly twist the blade after heating it as described above so
that the flat part of the blade, and not just the edge, hits the string.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Metal fingerpicks may need to be slightly rotated on the finger to
address this problem. You also may need to evaluate and adjust your picking hand
and wrist posture to insure proper sting attack. I now rub some lip balm on the
leading edge of the pick, which lubricates it, and that seems to eliminate the
scraping sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;<o:p>
 &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The metal fingerpicks will cause a scraping
sound if they are not smooth and free of dirt. Buff the blade of a pick on a
chamois or on your blue jeans so itÂ’s shiny. Also try lubricating them with
lip balm. Stainless steel picks will
generally give you the potentially cleanest sound.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You can easily get a scraping sound just
from the accumulated grime on the string itself, just from picking one song.
Cleaning the individual strings near the bridge with the chamois will help.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It would be appropriate here to comment on
the choice of string gauges and metals. This is subject to a wide range of
personal preferences. I don’t think that the thickness of the string impacts
their longevity as long as they are kept clean. Some swear by a phosphor bronze
wound fourth string versus a nickel steel-wound fourth to eliminate the scraping
sound, but I haven’t found a real difference. I am sure some readers would
disagree on this, and I welcome others’ suggestions regarding their solutions
to this thumbpick scraping sound.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The question always arises: “How often
should I change my strings?” I find that in the hot humid summer, my strings
die out as often as once a week or more if I play outdoors often. In the dry
winter, they can last months if I take care of them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If none of the above helps to reduce the
scraping sound, don’t reach for the Valium just yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Try taking a different pick out of your pocket and using it. Believe it
or not, just alternating back and forth between picks after a few songs somehow
relieves the scraping problem in a satisfactory way. I’m not sure why. It
seems that giving the pick a bit of a rest helps somehow. It remains a mystery
to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
