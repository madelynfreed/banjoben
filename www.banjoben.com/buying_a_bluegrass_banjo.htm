<p align="center">Buying your first bluegrass banjo</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFF00">Q. What kind of banjo do I need?&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left">A. You need to get a <b>five-string</b> model, as opposed to one
with four strings. It is simply not possible to play &quot;Scruggs style&quot;
banjo with a four sting model.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"> <font color="#FFFF00">Question: I want to buy my first bluegrass banjo to learn on. Do I
need one with a resonator or tone ring?</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. No, If you want to learn, get yourself a
cheap banjo to start with. A resonator(the round wooden back that reflects the sound towards
the audience)&nbsp; and a heavy tone ring is not needed to start. In other
words, you can learn on an inexpensive lower cost &quot;open-back&quot; banjo. Think about spending
under $500 for your first banjo.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"> What's most
important at first is not how fancy or expensive the first banjo is but accepting the fact that in order to learn how to play you
must <i> practice every day if possible, for at least a half an hour.</i>  You
do not need an expensive banjo to start. After a year or more of real picking, after you have made a
real commitment to the instrument, then you can think about spending big bucks
on a &quot;good&quot; banjo(now around $2000, or more).&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">If you are looking around at new beginner models, consider a <i>
<b>
Deering &quot;Goodtime&quot;</b></i> or <b> <i> Goldtone &quot;Cripple Creek&quot;</i></b>,
or the&nbsp; <b><i>Recording King </i> &quot;Madison&quot; </b>all open-back banjos under
$400. Go to <a href="http://elderly.com//new_instruments/items/RKB20.htm">http://elderly.com</a>
<i>.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p align="left">Make sure that whatever banjo you start out with is adjusted
properly. Even high priced banjos can leave the manufacturer completely out of
adjustment. Ask the person who is selling you the banjo to make sure it is set
up before you receive it.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"> <font color="#FFFF00">Q. Why are some 5-string banjos so
heavy?</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. A good bluegrass banjo has a brass or
bronze &quot;tone
ring&quot;, over which is stretched the plastic &quot;head&quot;. A good tone
ring is very heavy, which accounts for the weight of the expensive banjos.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Reputable on-line dealers of banjos include Turtle Hill Banjos,
Janet Davis, Elderly Instruments, and Curtis McPeake.</p>
